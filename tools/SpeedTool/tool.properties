# The category of your tool, must be one (or many) of the following:
#   "3D"            "Animation"     "Compilations"      "Data"

# If a value other than those listed is used, your tool will listed as "Other".

# A short sentence (or fragment) to summarize the tool's function. This will be
# shown from inside the PDE when the tool is being installed. Avoid repeating
# the name of your tool here. Also, avoid saying anything redundant like
# mentioning that it's a tool. This should start with a capitalized letter, and
# end with a period.
sentence = Adding features for faster code editing to the PDE.

# Additional information suitable for the Processing website. The value of
# 'sentence' always will be prepended, so you should start by writing the
# second sentence here. If your tool only works on certain operating systems,
# mention it here.
paragraph = Brackets and Quotes get closed automatically.  

# Links in the 'sentence' and 'paragraph' attributes can be inserted using the
# same syntax as for authors. 
# That is, [here is a link to Processing](http://processing.org/)


# A version number that increments once with each release. This is used to 
# compare different versions of the same tool, and check if an update is 
# available. You should think of it as a counter, counting the total number of 
# releases you've had.
version = 2  # This must be parsable as an int

# The version as the user will see it. If blank, the version attribute will be 
# used here.
